# Git fundamentals

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects by managing revisions of code, tracking changes, and coordinating work between team members. Git is designed to be fast, efficient, and flexible, enabling developers to work offline and merge changes seamlessly. It is widely used in the software industry and is considered an essential tool for modern software development workflows.

## How does this intersect with JiaoziFS?

Git and JiaoziFS have many intersections, primarily in **version control** and **management**. Here are their intersections:

+ **Version Control**: Git is a popular version control system used to track changes in files and facilitate collaborative development. Similarly, JiaoziFS also offers version control functionality, but it focuses on **data version control**, including datasets, models, and experiment results. Therefore, Git and JiaoziFS provide version control at different levels, complementing each other in software development and data management.

+ **Collaborative Development**: Git promotes collaborative development among teams through features like branching, merging, and committing. Likewise, JiaoziFS supports collaboration among team members, but it emphasizes **data sharing**, **collaboration**, and **management** to ensure effective cooperation and resource sharing in data-driven projects.

+ **Data Management**: While Git is primarily used for managing code and text files, it can also manage any type of file. JiaoziFS, on the other hand, focuses on **data management**, offering more specific features for data, such as **data version control**, **data provenance**, and **data reproducibility**. Therefore, Git and JiaoziFS share a common goal in data management, helping users effectively manage and utilize data resources.
